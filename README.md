WordPress Post To Twitter
=========================

A small plugin for WordPress which makes it very easy to make a post to Twitter.

# Installation
- Make sure the contents are extracted to the plugins directory of WordPress. Next, activate the plugin "Post To Twitter".
- At https://apps.twitter.com/ you have to create a new app. You need 4 keys for Post To Twitter to work: Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret. Make sure the "Access level" is set to "Read and write" and not to "Read only" (because then Post To Twitter won't be able to post a tweet).
- After that, you have to fill in these codes in the WordPress dashboard under "Settings" => "Post To Twitter". You can press "Test" to test if the function works. A tweet will be posted to your Twitter account.
- If you're adding or editing a post, you'll now see a new box called "Post To Twitter". You can select whether a tweet should be made, if you want to send the featured image or if you want to send a custom text.
